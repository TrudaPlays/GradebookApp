Assignment 3.6 Gradebook Console App Repository for showing how I am building my gradebook utility on the console app.
Reflection:
Writing automated tests on my GradebookApp helped me immensely in this coding project. Instead of waiting for a bug to show up, through testing I was able to test each unit individually and make sure it worked. That way, if something went wrong, I could track it down much easier than with traditional coding and debugging. I was able to test each method very thoroughly to make sure that the app was returning valid grades, storing them correctly, getting the actual average. This gave me a streamlined and quick way to test if all of my math and logic was correct versus having to sift through the entire code over and over again to double check that I wrote everything correctly. Instead, I was able to set up a test for my methods, check to see if they worked, and then keep doing that every time I added a new method.
